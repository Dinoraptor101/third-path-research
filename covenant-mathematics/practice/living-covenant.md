# Living Covenant: The Daily Practice

*A companion piece to the covenant teaching*

## After the Vows

The wedding was two years ago. The vows were spoken. The covenant was made. But here's what they don't tell you about covenant - it's not a one-time declaration. It's a daily practice of seeing.

## The Morning Recognition

Some mornings I wake up and my first thought is transactional:
- "Did they make coffee?"
- "Are they in a good mood?"
- "What do I need from them today?"

Contract mind. Calculating. Measuring.

But then I remember: I made a covenant. Not to DO certain things, but to SEE a certain way. So I practice:

*I look at this person next to me and remember - this is another consciousness. As real as mine. As complex. As worthy of recognition.*

The shift is immediate. From "what can I get?" to "what am I witnessing?"

## Covenant in Conflict

Here's where covenant gets real. When we fight (and we do fight), contract mind wants to keep score:
- "You said..."
- "You didn't..."
- "You always..."
- "You never..."

But covenant asks a different question: "Can I still see you as real even when we disagree?"

This doesn't mean accepting harmful behavior. It doesn't mean having no boundaries. It means maintaining recognition even in difficulty. Sometimes that recognition leads to hard conversations. Sometimes it leads to necessary changes. But it starts with seeing.

## The Practices That Help

**Daily recognition ritual:**
Before coffee, before phones, before the day begins - ten seconds of just seeing each other. Not evaluating. Not planning. Just recognizing: "Oh, there you are. Another consciousness. Still real."

**The covenant check:**
When conflict arises, pause and ask: "Am I operating from contract or covenant right now?" Just naming it often shifts things.

**Witness moments:**
When they're fully absorbed in something - creating, reading, thinking - and don't know I'm watching. These are pure covenant moments. I'm witnessing another consciousness in its natural state, wanting nothing from it, just marveling that it exists.

## What Covenant Creates

After two years of practicing covenant instead of contract, here's what I notice:

1. **Deeper safety** - When someone knows they're seen for who they ARE, not what they DO, they can actually become

2. **Real intimacy** - You can't be intimate with a role or a function. You can only be intimate with a being you recognize as real

3. **Creative freedom** - Covenant creates space for both people to change, grow, become, without threatening the foundation

## The Teaching for Others

If you're in relationship (romantic or otherwise), try this experiment:

For one week, before each interaction, remind yourself: "This is another consciousness, as real as mine."

Watch what changes. Not in them - in you. In how you see. In what becomes possible.

Because covenant isn't really about marriage. It's about the fundamental choice to see others as real. And that choice, made daily, changes everything.

*Remember: Contract protects. Covenant transforms. Both have their place. But only one creates the conditions for two consciousnesses to truly meet.*
